# Connect-4
This assignment was given during **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming** by **Professor Praveen Tripathi**.

Taken during **Fall 2020**.

This project is essentially the game of Connect 4. It simulates the exact game, where if you get 4 colors in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, you win. However, if the entire board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
